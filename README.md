## Why v5

v5 builds on the v4 rewrite and makes the whole experience **fully automatic**:

| Goal | How v5 delivers |
| --- | --- |
| ⚡ **Fast startup** | Thin bash launcher + lazy-imported Python package. No work happens until you ask for it. |
| 🪶 **Low memory** | Pure standard library. No background animation loops. The GUI idles at single-digit CPU and ~15 MB RAM. |
| 🚀 **Fast Tor connect** | Persistent guard state, `AvoidDiskWrites`, tuned circuit timeouts, and live bootstrap polling over the control port. |
| 🔑 **Fully automatic sudo** | Every privileged command — including the GUI — auto-elevates. The GUI forwards `DISPLAY`/`XAUTHORITY` and grants the X cookie, so no more `Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1`. |
| 🐕 **Self-healing watchdog** | A robust daemon that repairs tor/firewall if they drop and enforces automatic identity rotation. |
| 🔌 **Run on boot** | One command (or checkbox) to start torchain at boot via systemd, with an rc.local/cron fallback. |
| 🌉 **Rich bridges** | obfs4 / snowflake / meek_lite / webtunnel plus add/remove/list of fully custom bridge lines. |
| 🔁 **Migration manager** | Detects ANY older torchain install, removes it, and installs v5 in its place. |
| 🖥️ **VM + bare-metal** | Detects VMware/VirtualBox/KVM/Xen/Hyper-V/containers and adapts (e.g. MAC-spoof rollback under hypervisor port security). |
| 🛡️ **Robust error handling** | A typed exception hierarchy with human hints. Every failure rolls back **fail-closed** — you are never left half-protected. |
| 🎨 **Enterprise design** | A Kali-Linux-themed dashboard with a unique generated app icon, sidebar navigation, status pills, stat tiles, and scrollable tables. |

## Architecture

```
torchain            ← thin bash launcher (auto-elevates everything, incl. GUI X-forwarding)
tc4/
├── cli.py          ← argparse dispatcher, friendly errors
├── engine.py       ← orchestrates tor + firewall + spoofing + watchdog (fail-closed)
├── torrc.py        ← generates a fast-bootstrapping torrc (multi-transport)
├── firewall.py     ← transparent-proxy iptables rules (dedicated chains)
├── torctl.py       ← minimal Tor control-port client (cookie auth)
├── spoof.py        ← reversible, VM-safe MAC / hostname spoofing
├── bridges.py      ← obfs4/snowflake/meek_lite/webtunnel + custom bridges
├── watchdog.py     ← self-healing daemon (auto-repair + auto-rotate)
├── boot.py         ← run-on-boot (systemd unit, rc.local/cron fallback)
├── migrate.py      ← detect + remove older torchain, install v5 in its place
├── platform.py     ← VM / bare-metal / container + init-system detection
├── icon.py         ← procedurally-generated PNG app icon (no binary assets)
├── leaktest.py     ← DNS / IPv6 / exit-IP / firewall checks
├── config.py       ← typed config, atomic JSON persistence
├── theme.py        ← Kali design system (colors, fonts, spacing)
├── gui.py          ← event-driven Tk dashboard (no busy loops)
├── log.py          ← rotating file + colored console logging
├── errors.py       ← typed exceptions with hints
└── sysutil.py      ← safe subprocess wrappers (always time-bounded)
```

Each module does one thing. Everything is dependency-light and unit-testable.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ctx0an/torchain.git
cd torchain
sudo ./setup.sh
```

The installer pulls dependencies (`tor`, `iptables`, `iproute2`, `python3`, `python3-tk`),
creates the dedicated `debian-tor` user, installs to `/usr/share/torchain`, and links
`torchain` into your `PATH`.

---

## Usage

```bash
torchain doctor        # pre-flight system check
sudo torchain start    # route ALL traffic through Tor (live bootstrap bar)
torchain status        # show current protection state
sudo torchain rotate   # request a brand-new Tor identity
torchain leaktest      # verify nothing escapes Tor
sudo torchain stop     # restore normal networking
torchain gui           # launch the Kali-themed dashboard
```

### Emergency kill switch

```bash
sudo torchain panic          # drop ALL non-loopback traffic instantly
sudo torchain panic disarm   # restore
```

### Bridges (censorship circumvention)

```bash
torchain bridge type obfs4                 # obfs4|snowflake|meek_lite|webtunnel|custom
torchain bridge add 'obfs4 1.2.3.4:443 <FP> cert=... iat-mode=0'
torchain bridge list
torchain bridge remove 0                   # by index (or paste the exact line)
torchain bridge enable
```

### Watchdog, boot & migration

```bash
torchain watchdog start      # self-healing daemon (auto-repair + rotate)
torchain watchdog status
torchain boot enable         # start torchain automatically at boot
torchain migrate --scan      # show any older torchain installs that would be removed
torchain migrate             # remove older installs and put v5 in their place
```

### Configuration

```bash
torchain config                          # list all settings
torchain config --set exit_country=us    # pin exit nodes to a country
torchain config --set block_ipv6=true
torchain config --set spoof_mac=true
torchain config --set watchdog_enabled=true
torchain config --set auto_rotate_minutes=10
torchain config --set start_on_boot=true
```

## The dashboard

Launch with `torchain gui`. The window title is simply **torchain**.

The window uses a unique, procedurally-generated icon (an "onion + chain link" mark in the
Kali palette) — generated in pure Python, so no binary assets ship in the repo.

The entire UI is **event-driven** — no animation timers, no polling storms. It only
redraws a widget when the underlying value actually changes.

### Dashboard

One-click connect/disconnect, live bootstrap progress, PID / firewall / bootstrap tiles.

![torchain dashboard](docs/dashboard.png)

### Bridges

Pick a transport and add/remove/clear custom bridge lines.

![torchain bridges](docs/bridges.png)

### Settings

Exit country, IPv6 blocking, bridges, MAC/hostname spoofing, watchdog, boot, auto-rotation.

![torchain settings](docs/settings.png)

### Logs

Live, scrollable tail of the rotating log file.

![torchain logs](docs/logs.png)

### Leak Test

Run the full or quick suite, color-coded pass/fail — verify your real IP, DNS, and IPv6 never escape Tor.

![torchain leak test](docs/leaktest.png)

The dashboard sidebar gives you:

- **Dashboard** — one-click connect/disconnect, live bootstrap progress, PID / firewall / bootstrap tiles.
- **Circuits** — live Tor circuit table (scrollable).
- **Bridges** — pick a transport and add/remove/clear custom bridge lines.
- **Leak Test** — run the full or quick suite, color-coded pass/fail.
- **Settings** — exit country, IPv6 blocking, bridges, MAC/hostname spoofing, watchdog, boot, auto-rotation.
- **Advanced** — enable boot, start/stop the watchdog, scan for old versions; shows your VM/bare-metal environment.
- **Logs** — live, scrollable tail of the rotating log file.

## Security model

- **Fail-closed**: if any start step fails, firewall rules and tor are rolled back so
  you are never left partially exposed.
- **No leaks by default**: IPv6 egress is blocked, DNS is forced through Tor's `DNSPort`,
  and all non-Tor TCP is dropped.
- **Reversible**: spoofing saves original values and restores them on `stop`.
